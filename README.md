# WeatherMood(https://weather-mood.vercel.app/)

#### "Weather Mood" is a modern and responsive weather application built with React that provides accurate weather information and forecasts to users. It leverages two APIs - OpenWeatherMap and GeoDB Cities - to fetch real-time weather and location data, respectively.
#### With "Weather Mood", users can easily search for and track the weather in their current location or any location around the world. The app provides detailed weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation levels. It also includes a 7-day forecast and displays weather data in an intuitive and visually appealing manner.
#### In addition to providing weather information, Weather Mood also has a unique feature that recommends an outfit based on the current weather. This feature takes into account the temperature, wind, and humidity to provide a suggestion for an outfit that would be comfortable and appropriate for the weather conditions.
#### "Weather Mood" is deployed using Vercel, ensuring fast and reliable performance for users. It's built with a clean and modular codebase, making it easy to maintain and extend with new features.

Try out "Weather Mood" today and stay up-to-date on the weather in your area!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
